## Example Snippet
\`\`\`
Speaker 1: You know what's cool about this commit? They basically gave our shopping cart a memory upgrade!

Speaker 2: A memory upgrade? Like when I finally added more RAM to my laptop?

Speaker 1: Exactly! See this cache implementation here? Before, our cart would "forget" what was in it after 30 minutes. Now it's like... imagine your cart having a notebook where it writes down everything you add, and it keeps those notes for a full 24 hours.

Speaker 2: Ahh, so no more of that annoying "your session has expired" message when I'm taking my time shopping?

Speaker 1: *laughs* Precisely! Way fewer angry customers having to refill their carts...
